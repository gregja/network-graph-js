# network-graph-js
network hierarchical graph with vis js and the dot language

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/gregja/pen/MWWvxjm](https://codepen.io/gregja/pen/MWWvxjm).

I created this pen to test different rendering of graphs. 
I started with an example proposed by vis.js, and I combined it with DOT datas taken on Wikipedia :
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)

For explanations about importing DOT data into Vis.js (go to paragraph "Import data in DOT language"), :
